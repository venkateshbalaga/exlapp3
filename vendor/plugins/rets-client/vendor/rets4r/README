= RETS4R

RETS4R provides a native Ruby interface to the RETS (Real Estate
Transaction Standard). It currently is built for the 1.5 specification,
but support for 1.7 and 2.0 are planned. It does not currently implement
all of the specification, but the most commonly used portions.
Specifically, there is no support for Update transactions.

While this is the only "native" Ruby RETS library currently available
(to my knowledge), there is another client written in C++ with Ruby
bindings available from the Center for Realtor¨ Technology
(http://www.crt.realtors.org/projects/rets/librets/).

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.4 
* XML::Parser (Optional. If not present, REXML will be used.)

== License

Please see the LICENSE file.

== Acknowledgments

This project was made possible by the Contra Costa Association of
Realtors¨ (http://www.ccartoday.com).

== Getting Started

Take a look at the examples directory. You'll find it more helpful than
the unit tests because the unit tests work off of local files and mock
objects, rather than making real transaction calls.

Due to the nature of this library, it is HIGHLY recommended that you
have at least a basic understanding of the RETS protocol. The official
RETS website is http://www.rets.org.
