Ever wondered what exactly Rails returned in an RJS response ?  Here's your chance to see it:

  ===> text/javascript (49 bytes)
  Element.replace('target', '<em>It works!</em>');

  <===

== ResponseLogger

Logging the response value is easy.  Simply install the plugin and it works.  The plugin will not log the response body in non-development mode.

== Installation

Nothing could be simpler:

  $ script/plugin source svn://svn.teksol.info/svn/rails/plugins
  $ script/plugin install response-logger

Alternatively, you can install using <code class="svn property">svn:externals</code> by doing:

  $ script/plugin source svn://svn.teksol.info/svn/rails/plugins
  $ script/plugin install -x response-logger

== License

This plugin is released under the MIT License.
