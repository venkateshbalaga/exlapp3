= What is Flash Helper Plugin ?
This is a plugin to aid in the management of the Flash.

= What can I use it for ?
You use the Flash Helper Plugin like this:

app/controllers/account_controller.rb:
 class AccountController < ApplicationController
   def login
     if authenticated? then
       flash_notice 'Success - you are now logged in !'
     end
   end
 end

app/views/layouts/application.rhtml:
 <%= show_flash_messages :textilize => true %>

= Okay, but what is it REALLY used for ?
This is an aid to the standardization effort started by Luke Randall on the Rails mailing list.  For more information,
see this thread on the mailing list:  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.rails/28104

= Cool, but how do I use it ?
Drop the plugin in your vendor/plugin area, using one of these methods:
* svn export http://opensvn.csie.org/flash_helper_plugin/trunk vendor/plugins/flash_helper
* svn ps svn:externals "flash_helper http://opensvn.csie.org/flash_helper_plugin/trunk" vendor/plugins
* Get the .tar.gz or .zip file, and unpack into vendor/plugins

== How to use the unit test assertions ?
You only need to require the assertions.rb file in test/test_helper.rb:

test/test_helper.rb:
 require 'francois_beausoleil/flash_plugin_helper/assertions'
