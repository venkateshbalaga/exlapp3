Thank you again for activating your XLsuite account at <%= @domain.name %>!

For your convenience, we have automatically setup an XLsuite affiliate account for you.
You can login to your affiliate account using your email and same password as the one that you submit on your XLsuite account activation.

Here is the login url http://xlsuite.com/admin/affiliate_account/login.

With this affiliate account you are assigned an automatic affiliate id. You can use this affiliate id on all our affiliate programs and start earning money immediately by referring business.
For more information about our affiliate program and how it works, visit http://xlsuite.com/affiliates

And YES, it's completely free. So you have nothing to worry about.

Lastly, if you do not want to be an affiliate partner, just omit this email, pretend that you never read it and do nothing.
We are still keeping your affiliate account for another year though just in case you change your mind later on. A lot of people do :)

Best of luck on making more money!

Sincerely,
XLsuite Administrator
