Thank you again for signing up at <%= @domain.name %>!

The domain that you signed up on uses our XLsuite platform and we thought having our affiliate account would be beneficial for you.

For your convenience, we have automatically setup an XLsuite affiliate account for you.
You can login to your affiliate account using your email and same password as the one that you submit on your signup.

You can login directly through XLsuite's portal at http://xlsuite.com/admin/affiliate_account/login or through the domain at http://<%= @domain.name %>/admin/affiliate_account/login.

With this affiliate account you are assigned an automatic affiliate id. You can use this affiliate id on all our affiliate programs as well as <%= @domain.name %>'s and start earning money immediately by referring business.
For more information about how this XLsuite affiliate program works, please visit http://xlsuite.com/affiliates.

And YES, it's completely free. So you have nothing to worry about.

Lastly, if you do not want to be an affiliate partner, just omit this email, pretend that you never read it and do nothing.
We are still keeping your affiliate account for another year though just in case you change your mind later on. A lot of people do :)

Best of luck on making more money!

Sincerely,
XLsuite Administrator
